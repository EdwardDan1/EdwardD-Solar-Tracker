Issues I experienced:
  -	Code does not work as intended. The servos do not track the light but instead turn in a weird direction and stay that way.
  -	Voltmeter does not work. Although it is wired correctly it does not show the voltage 
  -	Even with new batteries the volt meter and servo do not work as inteneded

Introduce yourself and provide a brief background about your experience, skills, and interests related to the project.

Progression and Issues
Outline the steps you took during the project's development and the challenges you encountered. You can use bullet points or subsections to describe different stages or milestones.

Issue 1
Description of the issue: Code does not work as intended. The servos do not track the light but instead turn in a weird direction and stay that way.
Steps taken to troubleshoot: I tried adjusting the servos and looking at the code and changeing the tolerance within the code to hopefully fix the issue.
Solution or workaround: Took the Solar Tracker apart and re-zerod the servos again to make sure they were 100% correct. That was the underlying problem as I had zerod the servos upsidedown on my first attempt.

Issue 2
Description of the issue: Voltmeter does not work. Although it is wired correctly it does not show the voltage 
Steps taken to troubleshoot: Redid the connection and checked the wiring to the volt meter
Solution or workaround: NA

Issue 3
Description of the issue: Even with batteries the volt meter and servo do not work as inteneded
Steps taken to troubleshoot: Replaced the batteries with new ones and checked the wiring of the Solar Tracker
Solution or workaround: NA
