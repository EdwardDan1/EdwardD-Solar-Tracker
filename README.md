Issues I experienced:
  -	Code does not work as intended. The servos do not track the light but instead turn in a weird direction and stay that way.
  -	Voltmeter does not work. Although it is wired correctly it does not show the voltage 
  -	Even with new batteries the volt meter and servo do not work as inteneded
