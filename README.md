## About Me

Introduce yourself and provide a brief background about your experience, skills, and interests related to the project.

## Progression and Issues

Outline the steps you took during the project's development and the challenges you encountered. You can use bullet points or subsections to describe different stages or milestones.

### Issue 1
- Description of the issue: Code does not work as intended. The servos do not track the light but instead turn in a weird direction and stay that way.
- Steps taken to troubleshoot: I tried adjusting the servos and looking at the code and changeing the tolerance within the code to hopefully fix the issue.
- Solution or workaround: Took the Solar Tracker apart and re-zerod the servos again to make sure they were 100% correct. That was the underlying problem as I had zerod the servos upsidedown on my first attempt.

### Issue 2
- Description of the issue: Voltmeter does not work. Although it is wired correctly it does not show the voltage 
- Steps taken to troubleshoot: Redid the connection and checked the wiring to the volt meter
- Solution or workaround: NA
