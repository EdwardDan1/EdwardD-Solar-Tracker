# Solar Tracker
The initial objective of this project involved the successful construction of the Solar Tracker. During the assembly process, a minor setback occurred when I miscalibrated the servos, resulting in a slight delay. Nevertheless, once all the wiring and connections were in place, the Solar Tracker showcased its unique physical design, featuring a combination of horizontal and vertical components securely fastened together with screws and bolts. By incorporating photoresistors and employing servo-controlled dual-axis movement, this innovative system effectively addresses the challenge of maximizing solar exposure as it evolves throughout the day. The Solar Tracker exemplifies the fusion of cutting-edge technology and sustainable energy practices, showcasing the potential for improved solar panel positioning, heightened energy output, and a more ecologically aware future.

# Final Milestone
For your final milestone, explain the outcome of your project. Key details to include are:
- What you've accomplished since your previous milestone
- What your biggest challenges and triumphs were at BSE
- A summary of key topics you learned about
- What you hope to learn in the future after everything you've learned at BSE

# Second Milestone
The second milestone of this project was to successfully get the base project fully functional. To achieve this, I had to familiarize myself with the Arduino IDE, an integrated development environment used for programming Arduino microcontrollers. This software tool provided a user-friendly interface for writing, compiling, and uploading code to Arduino boards, allowing me to effectively develop and bring the project to fruition. I initially learned the basics of Arduino IDE before implementing the complete led code so I was able to read and tweak the code in the future.

# First Milestone
The first milestone of this project was to successfully assemble the Solar Tracker. After I had assembled it and run the code, I realized that the servos were not moving correctly. It took me a couple of days to realize that the problem was not the code, but an error I had made in zeroing the servos. Once all the wires and connections were properly established, the physical build of the Solar Tracker was complete. The Solar Tracker had a unique way of utilizing bolts and screws for all the connections, despite there being pieces that were connected both vertically and horizontally to each other.

# Schematics 
Here's where you'll put images of your schematics. [Tinkercad](https://www.tinkercad.com/blog/official-guide-to-tinkercad-circuits) and [Fritzing](https://fritzing.org/learning/) are both great resoruces to create professional schematic diagrams, though BSE recommends Tinkercad becuase it can be done easily and for free in the browser. 

# Code
Here's where you'll put your code. The syntax below places it into a block of code. Follow the guide [here]([url](https://www.markdownguide.org/extended-syntax/)) to learn how to customize it to your project needs. 

```c++
void setup() {
  // put your setup code here, to run once:
  Serial.begin(9600);
  Serial.println("Hello World!");
}

void loop() {
  // put your main code here, to run repeatedly:

}
```

# Bill of Materials

# Other Resources/Examples
One of the best parts about Github is that you can view how other people set up their own work. Here are some past BSE portfolios that are awesome examples. You can view how they set up their portfolio, and you can view their index.md files to understand how they implemented different portfolio components.
- [Example 1](https://trashytuber.github.io/YimingJiaBlueStamp/)
- [Example 2](https://sviatil0.github.io/Sviatoslav_BSE/)
- [Example 3](https://arneshkumar.github.io/arneshbluestamp/)
